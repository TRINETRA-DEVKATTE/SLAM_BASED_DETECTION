Abstract: An approach of robust localization for mobile robot working in indoor is proposed in this paper. A novel method for laser SLAM and visual SLAM fusion is introduced to provide robust localization. This architecture can be applied to a situation where any two kinds of laser-based SLAM and monocular camera-based SLAM can be fused together instead of being limited to single specific SLAM algorithm. While laser-based SLAM and monocular camera-based SLAM have their own strengths and drawbacks, the integration of these two kinds of SLAM algorithm can then promote the algorithmic effectiveness. Instead of using feature matching methods to achieve fusion procedure, trajectories matching is proposed with an attempt to achieve the generalization over all different kinds of SLAM algorithms, since localization is a natural function associated with any SLAM algorithm. It turns out that the hereby proposed approach is very lightweight during the run time, and the calculation can run in real-time without unnecessary computation waste. The experimental results show the localization error in terms of the real distance can be less than 5%. Furthermore, through the experiment the proposed system can be shown able to improve the localization when the sensors are not very powerful.

Abstract: This paper presents experiments on vision-based localization of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) using graph-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Relative range and bearing values of each landmark are obtained from image processing results. And a graph structure is built using the landmark detection results and dead-reckoning data of the AUV. The structured graph is optimized by a graph-based SLAM algorithm. Finally, the performance of the graph-based SLAM is compared to an EKF-based SLAM result.

doi: 10.1109/ICSPIS.2016.7869889
Abstract: In this paper, performance of relative and absolute simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) are studied in dealing with open and closed loop paths. SLAM techniques based on absolute landmark and robot positions (AMF) has global look at the environment. This property is used to error reduction in closed loop paths. However, in open loop path, its error value increases and performance decreases strongly. In SLAM techniques based on relative positions of landmarks (RMF), the environment is observed locally by the robot. The performance of these techniques in paths with closed or open loops look alike without significant difference. One of the reasons why researchers must pay more attention to RMF SLAM in comparison with AMF SLAM methods is their provable convergence besides their significant performance especially in open loop path.

Abstract: In this study, we designed a simulation using Robot Operating System (ROS) to offload one resource intense process - simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). A local client located in Malaysia fed laser sensor information to the cloud server hosting the SLAM process located in Singapore. The client and server were placed in the same network using VPN for ROS to operate normally. The average round trip time measured is 18.6540ms with a standard deviation of 23.7870ms. It is feasible to offload SLAM to a cloud server based on the result that we obtained. Extending on the result of our simulation, we conducted a study using a real robot with similar implementation. Based on our result, it is feasible to implement ROS on cloud for SLAM.

doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2966757
Abstract: Unlike traditional industrial robots, indoor service robots are usually required to possess high intelligence, such as the skills of flexible moving, precise spacial perceiving. And high intelligence is always accompanied by consuming complicated and expensive computation resources. One solution for indoor service robots is centralization of expensive computation resource so that it is possible to design a low cost client with a high-intelligence brain. However, as a fundamental intelligence function for mobile indoor robots, if a real-time visual Simultaneously Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) system is split into client and brain, it will be confronted with new challenges, such as the barrier of instant data sharing and performance degradation brought by network delay inbetween. To solve the problem, we focus on a framework and approach of cloud-based visual SLAM in this paper, and provide an efficient solution to offload the expensive computation and reduce the cost of robot clients. The integrated system is distributed in a 3-level Cloud with light-weight tracking, high precision dense mapping, and map sharing. Based on recent excellent algorithms, our system is able to run a real-time sparse tracking on the client, and a real-time dense mapping on the cloud server, which outputs an explicit 3D dense map. Only keyframes are sent to the local cloud center to reduce the network bandwidth requirement. Dense geometric pose estimation besides feature-based methods is computed to make the system resistant to feature-less indoor scenes. The camera poses associated with keyframes are optimized on the local computing cloud center, and are sent back to the client to decrease the trajectory drift. We evaluate the system on the Technical University of Munich (TUM) datasets, Imperial College London and National University of Ireland Maynooth (ICL-NUIM) datasets, and the real data captured by our robot in terms of visual odometry on the client side and dense maps generated on the server cloud. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show our cloud visual SLAM system is able to bear the network delay in Local Area Network (LAN), and it is an efficient vSLAM solution for indoor service robots with high intelligence from a centric brain.

doi: 10.1109/ICIAS.2016.7824105
Abstract: This paper discusses an implementation of Extended Kalman filter (EKF) in performing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). The implementation is divided into software and hardware phases. The software implementation applies EKF using Python on a library dataset to produce a map of the supposed environment. The result was verified against the original map and found to be relatively accurate with minor inaccuracies. In the hardware implementation stage, real life data was gathered from an indoor environment via a laser range finder and a pair of wheel encoders placed on a mobile robot. The resulting map shows at least five marked inaccuracies but the overall form is passable.

doi: 10.1109/RITAPP.2019.8932869
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a framework for distributed processing and transmission of key frames and map points, which are components of a sparse map built with feature based visual SLAM frameworks. The developed framework uses a client-server architecture that makes it possible to separate the map and key frame components of the visual SLAM for communication in real-time. We devise a mechanism to minimize the communication bottleneck that is encountered when transmitting map points.The implementation of transmitting map is generally a band-width intensive process. The designed architecture provides excellent overall map quality even in scenarios where map objects are lost in the communication process. We perform simulation based verifications and real world examples to illustrate the validity and robustness of our architecture. Our architecture provides the first such system to process and transmit full map information from client to server in real-time without sacrificing robustness.
